							<h4 class="text-primary">How many hours are you allowed to figure per week?</h4>
							<p>Usually, you're allowed to figure while you're studying if you're in UK on a Tier 4 (General) or student visa. You are advised to see the passport stamp/sticker on your entry clearance/ residence permit - if it says "Work"(and any changes) must be authorized" or "Able to figure as authorized by the secretary of State", you're allowed to figure alongside your studies.</p>
							<p>If your programme is degree-level or above, i.e. Bachelor's or Master's or research degree, you're permitted to figure a minimum of 20 hours per week during the term-time</p>
							<p>If your programme is below degree-level, e.g. Diploma or certificate course, you're permitted to figure a maximum of 10 hours hebdomadally during term-time.</p>
							<p>However, you are allowed to work full-time during your holidays. Students should note that 'term-time' is your actual classroom period including lectures, preparation for examination or your course work. Holidays are usually considered around Christmas and Easter and vacations after completion of your examinations</p>
							<p>If you a student visitor in UK, you're not allowed to figure , i.e. paid/unpaid employment or work placements.</p>
							<h4 class="text-primary">What kind of work are permitted to do?</h4>
							<p>International students can do most quite jobs but there are few exceptions. Students:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Must not be self-employed</li>
								<li>Must not be working as a professional sportsperson or give sports coaching</li>
								<li>Not allowed to take up full time permanent vacancy</li>
								<li>Must not be a performing artist.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>However, just in case you're required to undertake any internship or work placement which can involve performance then it must be assessed a part of your curriculum, e.g. music and dance courses</p>
							<p>You can also choose volunteering roles as an excellent thanks to gain new skills and improve your CV. Students should ensure that their emigration status allows taking up positions-even unpaid positions.</p>
